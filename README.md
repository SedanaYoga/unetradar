# Segmentation of Radial Artery USG Images using Convolutional Neural Network for Artery Access Insertion
Struggling with new stuff that called Deep Learning, but I guess lots of fun will struct my brain hahaha

## The Data

Primary data is used that consist of pre-processed image on **'./data/train/image'** and labeled images for training on **'/data/train/label'**.
Almost forgot, testing images provided on **'./data/test'**, testing path will also be the directory of predicted images (result of the project).
